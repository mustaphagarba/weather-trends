    "This notebook/PDF is the first submission by Mustapha Muhammad Garba for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. It's an exploration and comparison of global weather data as it compares to the city I'm currently in while doing this comparison: Abuja, Nigeria. Aside from the SQL query to extract the data to CSV, which I did on the Udacity interface, everything in this work was done with Python libraries:\n",
